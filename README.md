## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts

### Expected behaviour

- On first load, show the default timer settings.
- Allow users to start, pause, and reset the timer.
- Display a notification when the timer ends.
- Allow users to customize the timer durations and appearance settings.
- Save user preferences in local storage so they persist across sessions.
